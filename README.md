# DeepAIGameBot

# Features Task: Play against Medium Level Difficulty
- Play against a Computer bot using Deep Learning Algorithms.

# How to Use
- must have those folders
- must have python3.7 or higher
- must have tensorflow and all dependencies Pandas, Matplotlib, and Numpy, Keras
- check pip latest version
- must install sc2 using
    `pip3 install --user --upgrade`
- Anaconda users will have to install sc2 copy pasting folders into anaconda after install.

### Scouting and creation of resources
- stragetically place pylons and resources 
- supplies and resources take priority
- next step is to scout enemy using the minimap

### Attacking phase 
- attacking phase initiates after building the chosen type of troops.
- plays really well against medium
- more training and modeling needed with different algoritms. more to come for hard mode.

### Training Data 
- Models will be created after each iterations.

### what to build next 
- further try different algorithms and build a better winning ratio for hard mode.
